## Overview

Implement comprehensive multi-platform support for r-hyprconfig that enables seamless operation across different Linux distributions and deployment scenarios, with specialized NixOS integration for declarative configuration management. This feature will provide automatic distribution detection, intelligent configuration file handling, profile management, and robust import/export capabilities.

## User Stories

### Cross-Distribution Configuration Management

As a Linux system administrator managing multiple workstations, I want r-hyprconfig to automatically detect my distribution and handle configuration files appropriately, so that I can use the same tool consistently across Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, and other distributions without manual configuration path adjustments.

The system should automatically detect the current Linux distribution, locate the appropriate Hyprland configuration directories, and handle any distribution-specific configuration file formats or naming conventions. Users should experience identical functionality regardless of their underlying distribution.

### NixOS Declarative Integration

As a NixOS user following declarative system management principles, I want to export my Hyprland configurations as NixOS modules (both traditional and home-manager compatible), so that my window manager settings integrate seamlessly with my existing system configuration and can be version-controlled and reproduced across systems.

The application should generate properly structured NixOS configuration modules that follow Nix best practices, support both system-level and home-manager configurations, and provide bidirectional conversion between interactive TUI settings and declarative Nix expressions.

### Profile and Preset Management

As a Hyprland user with different use cases (work, gaming, presentations), I want to create, save, and switch between configuration profiles, so that I can quickly adapt my desktop environment to different contexts without manually reconfiguring settings each time.

The system should provide an intuitive interface for creating named profiles, saving current configurations as presets, and quickly switching between different setups. Profiles should be portable and shareable between systems.

## Spec Scope

1. **Distribution Detection and Adaptation** - Automatic detection of Linux distribution and intelligent handling of distribution-specific configuration file locations and formats
2. **NixOS Module Generation** - Export current configurations as NixOS-compatible modules for both traditional NixOS and home-manager workflows
3. **Configuration Profile System** - Create, manage, and switch between named configuration profiles for different use cases
4. **Import/Export Framework** - Comprehensive system for importing existing configurations and exporting to multiple formats
5. **Cross-Platform File Management** - Intelligent configuration file discovery and management across different Linux distributions

## Out of Scope

- Windows or macOS support (Hyprland is Linux-only)
- Wayland compositor alternatives beyond Hyprland
- Distribution package management or system-level installations
- Remote configuration synchronization (planned for Phase 5)
- Real-time multi-system configuration sharing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can run r-hyprconfig on any major Linux distribution and have it automatically detect and handle their system's configuration structure correctly
2. NixOS users can export their configurations as proper Nix modules that integrate with their existing system configurations
3. All users can create, save, load, and manage multiple configuration profiles through an intuitive TUI interface
