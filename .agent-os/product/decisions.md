### Decision

Create r-hyprconfig, a modern Rust-based TUI application for visually configuring Hyprland window manager settings through an intuitive interface that integrates directly with hyprctl commands and provides automatic configuration file management for both standard Linux distributions and NixOS workflows.

### Context

Hyprland is a powerful tiling window manager, but its configuration process is complex and intimidating for new users. The command-line interface requires memorizing numerous hyprctl options and syntax, creating a steep learning curve. Additionally, there's no unified solution that works seamlessly across different Linux distributions, particularly for NixOS users who need declarative configuration management.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Web-based Configuration Tool**
   - Pros: Rich UI possibilities, familiar interface paradigm, easy styling
   - Cons: Additional overhead, requires browser, complex deployment, resource heavy

2. **Python GTK Application**
   - Pros: Native GUI, rich widget set, good Linux integration
   - Cons: Python dependency, larger resource footprint, GTK version conflicts

3. **Shell Script Collection**
   - Pros: Minimal dependencies, easy to understand, lightweight
   - Cons: Poor user experience, limited interface capabilities, hard to maintain

### Rationale

We chose a Rust TUI application because it provides the optimal balance of performance, user experience, and deployment simplicity. Rust offers native performance with memory safety, while ratatui provides a modern terminal interface that integrates seamlessly with developer workflows. The TUI approach eliminates GUI dependencies while still providing an intuitive interface, and direct hyprctl integration ensures real-time configuration changes without requiring restarts.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Native performance with minimal resource usage
- Seamless integration with terminal-based workflows
- Cross-platform compatibility without GUI dependencies
- Real-time configuration updates through hyprctl
- Modern, maintainable codebase in Rust
- Universal Linux distribution support including NixOS

**Negative:**
- Limited to terminal environments (no graphical desktop integration)
- Learning curve for users unfamiliar with TUI applications
- Rust compilation requirements for building from source
- Terminal-only interface may limit some advanced visual previews
